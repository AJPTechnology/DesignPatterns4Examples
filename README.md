Design Patterns Singleton Factory Method Facade Observer 

The Factory Method pattern is intended to develop The example of a construction of instances of
banking systems, for example an ATM system and mbway;

• In the Singleton pattern we will create entities responsible for transfers and payments. These entities are unique and cannot be replicated.

• In the Facade pattern, we are going to create a class that initializes all entities of type singleton and
that works as an interface for communication between the customer and payments and transfers.

• Banking operations are carried out according to two entities: customer and banking entity. All
banking entities must be unique and responsible for recording all operations carried out. The clients
are entities that must be registered with the banking entities.

• In the Observer pattern there will be an entity that is responsible for the communications, which will be
responsible for sending notifications to the entities involved: customers and banking entities.

This is merely an exercise where we can see how to correctly apply development patterns
